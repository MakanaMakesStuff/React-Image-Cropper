### React Cropper

#### See a running example of this project here:
https://icropalot.herokuapp.com/

#### What is it?
An image cropper I created using typescript, canvas html element, and react. The project is compiled as a nextjs app and deployed to a staging site pasted above.

If you can make use of this and or make it better please go ahead. I would like to people to engage :)
